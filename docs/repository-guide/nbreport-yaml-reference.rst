nbreport.yaml file format reference
###################################

Every report template repository has an :file:`nbreport.yaml` file that defines metadata about the report repository.
This page describes every field you might find in an :file:`nbreport.yaml` file, keeping in mind that some fields are optional.

An example :file:`nbreport.yaml` file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   handle: TESTR-001
   title: Characterization Metric Report Demo
   git_repo: https://github.com/lsst-sqre/nbreport
   ipynb: TESTR-001.ipynb
   assets:
     - '**/*.fits'
     - 'mydata.csv'
   git_repo_subdir: tests/TESTR-001
   ltd_product: testr-001
   published_url: https://testr-001.lsst.io
   ltd_url: https://keeper.lsst.codes/products/testr-001

handle
======

The handle is a short identifier for the report series.
nbreport does not prescribe a format for handles, but typically there is a series prefix and a serial number suffix.

.. code-block:: yaml

   handle: TESTR-001

.. _yaml-title:

title
=====

The title of the report series.

.. code-block:: yaml

   title: Characterization Metric Report Demo

.. _yaml-ipynb:

ipynb
=====

Set this field to the name of the report's Jupyter Notebook file, including the ``.ipynb`` extension.

.. code-block:: yaml

   ipynb: TESTR-001.ipynb

.. _yaml-assets:

assets (optional)
=================

If the report's Jupyter Notebook relies other files to execute, and those files are part of the notebook repository, you can mark them as assets with the ``assets`` field.
*Assets* are files, other than the ``ipynb`` notebook file, that are copied from report repository and made available to the report instance when it is rendered and computed (see `nbreport init`_).
Directory structure is preserved when asset files are copied from the report repository to the instance.

The assets field takes a **list** of strings that designate files as assets:

.. code-block:: yaml

   assets:
     - '**/*.fits'
     - 'mydata.csv'

There are three supported ways to designate assets:

- **The file name.**
  
  Simply name the file (relative to the root of the report repository) and it will be designated as an asset.

  .. code-block:: yaml

     assets:
       - 'mydata.csv'
       - 'images/image.fits`

  This example names two files, :file:`mydata.csv` and :file:`images/fits`, as assets.

- **A directory name.**

  The directory, and any files and subdirectories contained inside it, are copied from the report repository to the instance.

  .. code-block:: yaml

     assets:
       - 'images'

  In this example, :file:`images` directory (and its contents) is designated as an asset.

- **A glob pattern.**

  In addition to simple globs (such as ``*.fits``), recursive globs are also supported (``**/*.fits``).

  .. code-block:: yaml

     assets:
       - 'images/*.fits'
       - '**/*.csv'

  In this example, any FITS file in the :file:`images` directory is designated as an asset.
  All CSV files are also designated as assets.

.. _yaml-git-repo:

git\_repo (optional)
====================

The URL of the Git repository that this report template is published to.
This field is not necessary for local demos, though it is expected by the `nbreport register`_ command.
Setting this field also helps nbreport including information about the source Git repository in report instances.

.. code-block:: yaml

   git_repo: https://github.com/lsst-sqre/nbreport

.. _yaml-git-repo-subdir:

git\_repo\_subdir (optional)
============================

If the report template is part of a Git repository (:ref:`git\_repo <yaml-git-repo>` is set), but the repository *is not* located at the root of that Git repository, you can specify the subdirectory where the report template is located by setting the ``git_repo_subdir`` field.

If the report template occupies the root of the Git repository, this field should be omitted.

.. code-block:: yaml

   git_repo_subdir: tests/TESTR-001

In this example, the report repository is located in the ``tests/TESTR-001`` directory of the ``https://github.com/lsst-sqre/nbreport`` Git repository.

.. _yaml-ltd-product:

ltd\_product (optional)
=======================

This is the name of the report's registered `product name`__ with the *LSST the Docs* RESTful HTTP API (see also :ref:`ltd\_url <yaml-ltd-url>`).

.. __: https://ltd-keeper.lsst.io/products.html

Normally this field is set when you run the `nbreport register`_ command to register the report with the nbreport server.
If the report is not formally published, this field should not be set.

.. _yaml-published-url:

published\_url (optional)
=========================

The ``published_url`` field is the URL for the homepage the published reports.
The homepage indexes all available instances of a report series.

Normally this field is set when you run the `nbreport register`_ command to register the report with the nbreport server.
If the report is not formally published, this field should not be set.

.. code-block:: yaml

   published_url: https://testr-001.lsst.io

.. _yaml-ltd-url:

ltd\_url (optional)
===================

The ``ltd_url`` field is the URL for the report in the *LSST the Docs* RESTful HTTP API.
*LSST the Docs* is the service that hosts LSST documentation, including notebook-based reports.

Normally this field is set when you run the `nbreport register`_ command to register the report with the nbreport server.
If the report is not formally published, this field should not be set.

.. code-block:: yaml

   ltd_url: https://keeper.lsst.codes/products/testr-001

.. seealso::

   The `LTD Keeper documentation`__ describes this API.
